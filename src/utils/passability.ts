 * Auto-suggests per-vehicle passability and an overall road passability

 * levels and vehicle classes rather than arbitrary numbers — so a DRRM
 * editor and a driver reading the news are working off the same reference.
 * DRRM editors can override every field afterward — this is a starting
 * point, not a hard rule, since real passability also depends on current
 * flow speed and road condition.
 *
 * Clearance heuristics (meters of standing water), mapped to MMDA levels:
 *  - bike:        unsafe above Half-Knee level (~0.25m) — traction/debris risk
 *  - motor:       unsafe above Knee level (~0.48m) — engine intake risk
 *  - 4-wheel:     unsafe above Tire level (~0.66m) — floor pan / electronics
 *  - SUV/pickup:  unsafe above Waist level (~0.94m) — higher intake / clearance
 *  - truck:       unsafe above Chest level (~1.14m) — high clearance, heavy chassis
